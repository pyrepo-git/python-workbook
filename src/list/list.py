        Write a program that reads integers from the user and stores them in a list. Your
        program should continue reading values until the user enters 0. Then it should display
        all of the values entered by the user (except for the 0) in ascending order, with one
        value appearing on each line. Use either the sort method or the sorted function
        to sort the list.
